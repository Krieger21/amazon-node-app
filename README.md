# amazon-node-app
This is a node application that runs in terminal. It is built as an Amazon like storefront where people can select items from a databse and decide the quantity they would like to buy. All user inputs update the Sequel Pro Database that I have created beforehand.

This is how the user runs the program.

Once the user presses enter the item list prints to the node console and the user gets to choose which item they would like to purchase based on the item_id number. Then they are asked in what quantity they would like to buy the product.
